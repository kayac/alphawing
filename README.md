$ go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel
```

### Get alphawing

``` sh
$ go get github.com/kayac/alphawing/app
```

### Decide domain name for the application

ex. `example.com`

Because you have to enter the callback URL for the Google OAuth in the next step.

##### Client ID for Web application

1. Select **Create New Client ID**.
2. Choose **Web application**.
3. Enter the **AUTHORIZED REDIRECT URI** (ex. `http://example.com/callback`)
4. Select **Create Client ID**.

### Create database

You have to create database if you want to use the MySQL database or the SQLite single-file database.
(alphawing uses the SQLite in-memory database in the dev run mode by default.)

``` sql
CREATE DATABASE `alphawing` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8`;
```

### Edit config file

``` sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kayac/alphawing
$ cp conf/app.conf.sample conf/app.conf
```

You have to edit the following settings in `conf/app.conf`.
